# Supermarket-Bill-Registration---Speech-to-Text
This app prompts the user to speak the company name, bill number, and total amount one by one. If the speech is recognized successfully, it appends the data to an Excel file named "supermarket_bills.xlsx". If speech recognition fails or the input is unclear, it prompts the user to try again.
